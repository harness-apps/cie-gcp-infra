## Create Environment

We will use terraform to create a GKE cluster with `WorkloadIdentity` enabled for its nodes,

```shell
task init
```
  
## Deploy Harness Delegate

Ensure you have the following values set in the `.local.tfvars` before running the `task apply` command.

- Use **Account Id** from Account Overview as the value for **harness_account_id**,

![account details](docs/images/account_details.png)

- Use the `Harness Cluster Hosting Account` from the account details to find the matching endpoint URL. e.g for `prod-2` it is <https://app.harness.io/gratis> and set that as value for `harness_manager_endpoint`.

- Copy the default token from **Projects** --> **Project Setup** --> **Delegates**(**Tokens**) and set it as value for `harness_delegate_token`.

![copy](docs/images/harness_delegate_default_token.png)

- `harness_delegate_name`: defaults to **harness-delegate**

```shell
task create_delegate_infra
```

All the Drone runner artifacts will be created in "$PROJECT_HOME/runner". These include,

- `pool.yml`  - The Drone Runner VM pool
- `docker-compose.yml` - The Harness Delegate Docker Compose file
- `sa.json` - Google Service Account key to be used by Harness Delegate VM

Wait for the delegate to be connected before proceeding to next steps.

You can view status of the delegate from the **Project** --> **Project Setup** --> **Delegates** page,

## Build Application

Let us build an example application using the GCP VM Infra.

## Create Pipeline

Navigate to **Builds** --> **Pipelines**, click **Create Pipeline**.

![create pipeline](docs/images/create_pipeline.png)

Click **Add Stage**, select stage type to be **Build**

![build_stage](docs/images/add_build_stage.png)

Enter details about the stage, since we are testing the infra we will skip the **Clone Codebase**,

![stage details](docs/images/stage_details.png)

Click **Setup Stage** to create the stage.

Select the **Infrastructure** tab and select the **Infrastructure** to be **VMs**, **Platform** to be **Linux** with **Pool Name** set to our VM infra pool **debian-bullseye**.

![infra_details](docs/images/infra_details.png)

Click **Continue** to add **Step**, click **Add Step** on the **Execution** tab to add a step of type **Run** and configure the step details as shown,

![configure run step](docs/images/configure_run_step.png)

The following script used as part of the build step just runs a for minute printing _I am building something will be done soon!_ at every 10 second interval.

```shell
set -exo pipefail
curr_m=$(date "+%M")
((curr_m+=1))
while [ "$(date "+%M")" -lt "$curr_m" ]; do
    echo "I am building something will be done soon!"
    sleep 10
done
```

Click **Save** to complete the Pipeline creation,

![pipeline details](docs/images/pipeline_overview.png)

Since we have configured the pool count to be `1` in `pool.yml`, there should one runner VM created to consume builds. Run the following command to view them,

```shell
task runners
```

The command should show an output like,

```shell
NAME                                       ZONE           MACHINE_TYPE   PREEMPTIBLE  INTERNAL_IP  EXTERNAL_IP     STATUS
gcp-runner-debian-bullseye-hg4cfidf-ggd83  asia-south1-c  e2-standard-4               10.20.0.2    35.200.192.214  RUNNING
```

Click **Run** to run the pipeline to see the image build and pushed to GAR.
