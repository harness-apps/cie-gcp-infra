# Using Workload Identity

A demo to show how to use [Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/workload-identity) with Harness Pipelines.

In this demo we will build Harness CI pipeline that will use GKE as its build infrastructure. As part of the build infrastructure on GKE we will deploy a Harness Delegate to run our CI pipelines on our GKE.

## Pre-requisites

- [Google Cloud Account](https://cloud.google.com)
  - With a Service Account with roles
    - `Kubernetes Engine Admin` - to create GKE cluster
    - `Service Account` roles used to create/update/delete Service Account
      - iam.serviceAccounts.actAs
      - iam.serviceAccounts.get
      - iam.serviceAccounts.create
      - iam.serviceAccounts.delete
      - iam.serviceAccounts.update
      - iam.serviceAccounts.get
      - iam.serviceAccounts.getIamPolicy
      - iam.serviceAccounts.setIamPolicy
     Or simply you can add `Service Account Admin` and `Service Account User` roles
    - `Compute Network Admin`   - to create the VPC networks
  - Enable Cloud Run API on the Google Cloud Project, if you plan to deploy to Google Cloud Run
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk)
- [terraform](https://terraform.build)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [helm](https://helm.sh)
- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev)

Ensure that you have the following Harness Account Details,

- Harness Account ID
- Harness Delegate Token

### Optional tools

- [kustomize](https://kustomize.io)
- [direnv](https://direnv.net)

## Download Sources

Clone the sources,

```shell
git clone https://github.com/harness-apps/workload-identity-gke-demo.git && cd "$(basename "$_" .git)"
export DEMO_HOME="$PWD"
```

(OR) If you are using zsh, then you can use the following commands

```shell
take  https://github.com/harness-apps/workload-identity-gke-demo.git
export DEMO_HOME="$PWD"
```

## Environment Setup

### Variables

When working with Google Cloud the following environment variables helps in setting the right Google Cloud context like Service Account Key file, project etc., You can use [direnv](https://direnv.net) or set the following variables on your shell,

```shell
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="the google cloud service account key json file to use"
export CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME="the google cloud cli profile to use"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="the google cloud project to use"
```

You can find more information about gcloud cli configurations at <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/configurations>.

As you may need to override few terraform variables that you don't want to check in to VCS, add them to a file called `.local.tfvars` and set the following environment variable to be picked up by terraform runs,

```shell
export TFVARS_FILE=.local.tfvars
```

>**NOTE**: All `*.local.tfvars` file are git ignored by this template.

Check the [Inputs](#inputs) section for all possible variables that are configurable.
